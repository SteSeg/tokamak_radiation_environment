Coordinates are given by a couple of floating numbers and can refer to any of the 'xy', 'xz', 'yz' or 'rz' planes. The polygon gets then 'extruded' on the direction perpendicular to the reference plane for an undefined extension. In the case of 'rz' plane the extrusion is revolved around the z plane which is helpful in order to design toroidal geometries."
